# 2NPLGBM: A genomic model that merges the strengths of classical and machine learning methods in genomic prediction.
This repository introduces 2NPLGBM, a hybrid genomic prediction framework that bridges classical quantitative genetics and machine learning. The method is based on a novel 2NP genotype representation, constructed by concatenating the additive-centered genotype matrix (Z) and the dominance deviation matrix (W). This representation preserves biologically meaningful genetic structure while enabling modern ML algorithms to learn complex interaction patterns directly from the data.
